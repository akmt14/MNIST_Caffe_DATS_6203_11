### Training Convolution networks with Caffe on MNIST dataset

The objective of this miniproject is to become familiar with Caffe for training deep convolution networks on large datasets. You will be provided with a sample program that loads in the MNIST data set and sets up an example convolution network to be trained on it. (See
http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/gathered/examples/mnist.html for a discussion of this example.) The instructions below provide a rough framework of what you should do for the miniproject. You should experiment with using Caffe on this large dataset. The project
is open-ended. Learn as much as you can about using deep convolution networks, and relate what you have learned in your project report. For all parts below, and any other experiments you run, include the results into one PDF file, and upload it to the BlackBoard. Include all program listings, plots, command line printouts, discussion, etc.
